# Helps you get your :ticket: on Eventbrite

superbritebot is a very simple bot that lets you automate your ticket
registration on Eventbrite.

Itâ€™s a baby bot :baby: so it has lots of limitations for now. New features might
come later :baby_bottle:

Limitations are:

* only works with free ticket events
* only works with events with simple forms (email, last name and first name)

## How to use it?

```bash
cd superbritebot
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 superbritebot.py $EVENT_URL $FIRST_NAME $LASTNAME $EMAIL
```
